        <h1>Sovereign-Grade Advisory for VVIP Decision-Makers</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Modern missions fail less from lack of ambition than from lack of architecture.
          Istawra exists to convert national and institutional ambition into governed execution—
          where ambiguity is costly, timelines are unforgiving, and stakeholder complexity is material.

            <h3>Decision Integrity</h3>
            <p>

              authority and decision time.

        <p>
          Istawra supports decision-makers overseeing missions and transformations that span multiple

          and implementation must be aligned under executive control.

    <!-- HOW WE WORK -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>How We Work</h2>

        <p>
          Our approach is discrete, disciplined, and built for senior operating environments.
          We gather only the minimum signal required, produce VVIP-ready outputs, and maintain
          assurance under a governed cadence.
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            <h3>Mandate Definition</h3>
            <p>
              Confirm the decision-maker, objectives, timing, constraints, and boundaries of authority.
              Establish confidentiality and distribution rules.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Signal Gathering</h3>
            <p>
              Rapidly collect only what is necessary—executive interviews, key documents, stakeholder
              constraints, and factual baselines.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Architecture & Options</h3>
            <p>
              Construct decision architecture: options, trade-offs, dependencies, and what must be
              true for each path to succeed.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Governance & Control</h3>
            <p>
              Design decision rights, operating cadence, escalation pathways, and executive reporting
              to preserve accountability.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Activation & Assurance</h3>
            <p>
              Convert the chosen path into an executable portfolio and maintain assurance through
              periodic packs, risk monitoring, and corrective action tracking.
