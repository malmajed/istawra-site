        <p class="lead">
          Modern missions fail less from lack of ambition than from lack of architecture. Istawra is built to convert national and institutional
          ambition into governed execution—where ambiguity is costly, timelines are unforgiving, and stakeholder complexity is material.

        <p>
          Istawra supports decision-makers overseeing missions and transformations that span multiple entities, portfolios, and delivery pathways—particularly where
          governance, policy, funding, and implementation must be aligned under executive control.

        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach is discrete, disciplined, and built for senior operating environments. We gather only the minimum signal required, produce VVIP-ready outputs,
          and then maintain assurance under a governed cadence.
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            <h3>Mandate Definition</h3>
            <p>Confirm the decision-maker, objectives, timing, constraints, and boundaries of authority. Establish confidentiality and distribution rules.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Signal Gathering</h3>
            <p>Rapidly collect only what is necessary: executive interviews, key documents, stakeholder constraints, and factual baselines—noise is excluded by design.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Architecture & Options</h3>
            <p>Construct the decision architecture: options, trade-offs, dependencies, and what must be true for each path to succeed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Governance & Control System</h3>
            <p>Design decision rights, operating cadence, escalation pathways, and executive reporting to prevent drift and preserve accountability.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Activation & Assurance</h3>
            <p>Convert the chosen path into an executable portfolio and maintain assurance through periodic packs, risk monitoring, and corrective action tracking.</p>
