        <h1>Advisory Model</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Istawra provides sovereign-grade advisory to VVIP decision-makers operating in
          complex, multi-entity environments where clarity, governance, and execution
          discipline are decisive.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Our advisory model is mandate-based, senior-led, and governed by design—built
          to protect decision integrity and ensure that intent translates into outcomes.

    <!-- ADVISORY PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Advisory Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
          Istawra’s advisory philosophy is grounded in a simple premise: leadership does not
          need more information—it needs better decisions, clearer accountability, and
          controlled execution.
        </p>

        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Decision-Centric</h3>
            <p>
              Every engagement is oriented around explicit decisions: what must be decided,
              by whom, by when, and based on which assumptions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Governance-First</h3>
            <p>
              We design decision rights, escalation pathways, and operating cadence early,
              rather than retrofitting governance after problems emerge.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Execution-Aware</h3>
            <p>
              Advisory is inseparable from execution. Recommendations are constructed with
              full awareness of institutional capacity, incentives, and constraints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Independent by Design</h3>
            <p>
              Istawra maintains independence from delivery vendors and commercial interests
              unless explicitly mandated otherwise.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What Makes Istawra Different</h2>

        <p>
          Conventional advisory models often optimize for volume, utilization, or presentation.
          Istawra optimizes for decision quality and execution integrity.
        </p>

            <h3>Mandate-Based Engagements</h3>
            <p>
              Each engagement is defined as a mandate with explicit scope, authority,
              deliverables, cadence, and escalation rules.

            <h3>Senior-Led Delivery</h3>
            <p>
              Engagements are led by senior advisors with direct accountability—no delegation
              of critical thinking or decision framing.

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Lean Signal Collection</h3>
            <p>
              We collect only what is necessary to decide and execute. Noise, redundancy,
              and performative analysis are excluded by design.

        <h2>Advisory Lifecycle</h2>

        <p>
          While each mandate is unique, Istawra advisory engagements follow a disciplined
          lifecycle designed to move from intent to execution with minimal friction.

          <li>
            <h3>Decision Architecture</h3>

          <li>

            <h3>Activation & Assurance</h3>
