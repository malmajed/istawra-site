          Istawra provides sovereign-grade advisory to VVIP decision-makers where the cost of ambiguity is high,
          timelines are unforgiving, and stakeholder complexity is material. Our mandate is simple: convert ambition into
          governed execution with institutional discipline, measurable outcomes, and decision integrity.

        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach is designed to be discrete, disciplined, and effective in senior environments. We operate with “institution-first” governance and a controlled information model.
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            <h3>Mandate Definition</h3>
            <p>Confirm the decision-maker, objectives, time constraints, and the boundaries of authority. Establish confidentiality protocol and distribution rules.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Signal Gathering</h3>
            <p>Rapidly collect only what is necessary: executive interviews, key documents, stakeholder constraints, and factual baselines. Avoid noise by design.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Architecture & Options</h3>
            <p>Produce a clear decision architecture, options, and trade-offs. Document assumptions explicitly. Identify what must be true for each path to work.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Governance & Control System</h3>

          <li>
            <h3>Delivery Activation</h3>
            <p>Convert the selected path into an executable portfolio with owners, milestones, dependencies, and readiness gates.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Assurance & Course Correction</h3>
            <p>Maintain executive assurance through periodic packs and decision logs. Detect drift early and force corrective action with minimal disruption.</p>
