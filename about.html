        <h1>About Istawra</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Istawra Consulting is a sovereign-grade advisory institution built to support VVIP
          decision-makers navigating complex missions, institutional transformations, and
          multi-entity execution environments.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          We exist to serve leadership where the cost of ambiguity is high, the margin for error
          is narrow, and the consequences of weak governance are material.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT WE ARE -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>What Istawra Is</h2>

        <p>
          Istawra is not a traditional management consultancy. We do not operate on volume,
          headcount, or generic frameworks. We operate as an institutional extension of senior
          decision-making—focused on clarity, control, and execution integrity.
        </p>

        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="panel">
            <h3>An Advisory Institution</h3>
            <p>
              Istawra is designed as an institution, not a personality-driven practice. Our
              operating model emphasizes governance, repeatability, and disciplined delivery
              across mandates.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Sovereign-Grade by Design</h3>
            <p>
              Our work reflects the standards required in national programs, sovereign entities,
              and VVIP environments—where accountability, confidentiality, and execution rigor
              are non-negotiable.

        <h2>What Istawra Is Not</h2>

        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Not a Manpower Consultancy</h3>
            <p>
              We do not sell hours, staffing, or junior leverage. Every engagement is senior-led
              and output-driven.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Not a Slide Factory</h3>
            <p>
              Our outputs are decision instruments, governance artifacts, and execution controls—
              not presentation theater.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Not a Sales Platform</h3>
            <p>
              Istawra does not pursue open-ended sales funnels or unsolicited pitches. Engagements
              are selective and initiated through trusted channels.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="panel">
            <h3>Not a Vendor Proxy</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain independence from vendors and delivery providers unless explicitly
              mandated otherwise.

    <!-- WHY ISTAWRA -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why Istawra Exists</h2>

        <p>
          Many strategic initiatives fail not because of poor intent, but because ambition is
          not matched with institutional capability, governance discipline, or execution control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Istawra exists to close this gap—by translating leadership intent into structured
          missions, governed portfolios, and executable pathways that can survive complexity,
          politics, and time.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            We are most effective where multiple stakeholders, regulatory constraints, funding
            mechanisms, and delivery timelines intersect under executive authority.
